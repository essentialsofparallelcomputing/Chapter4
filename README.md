Most of these small code examples are in the main directory. They
are built with the Makefile in the main directory.

#  Listing1.c: 2D array allocation (Book: listing 4.1)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing1
      No output -- code is the example

# Listing2.c: Allocating a contiguous 2D array (Book: listing 4.2)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing2
      No output -- code is the example

# Listing3and4: Single contiguous memory allocation for 2D array (Book: listing 4.3 and 4.4)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Malloc2D
      No output -- code is the example

# Listing5.c: Array of Structures (AOS) code (Book: listing 4.5)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing5
      No output -- code is the example
 
# Listing6.c: Structure of Arrays (SOA) code (Book: listing 4.6)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing6
      No output -- code is the example
 
# Listing7.c: Spatial coordinate Array of Structures (Book: listing 4.7)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing7
      No output -- code is the example
 
# Listing8.c: Spatial coordinate Array of Structures (Book: listing 4.8)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing8
      No output -- code is the example

# Listing9.cc: Spatial coordinate class example (Book: listing 4.9)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing9
      No output -- code is the example
 
# Listing10.c: Hash Array of Structures (AOS) example (Book: listing 4.10)
      Build with make. Only generates an object file
      No program to run -- code is the example

# Listing11.c: Hash Structure of Arrays (SOA) example (Book: listing 4.11)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing11
      No output -- code is the example

# Listing12.c: Physics state Array of Structures (AOS) example (Book: listing 4.12)
      Build with make. Only generates an object file
      No program to run -- code is the example

# Listing13.cc: Hash Structure of Arrays (SOA) example (Book: listing 4.13)
      Build with make
      Run the program ./Listing13
      No output -- code is the example

# Stencil (Book: listing 4.14)
      In Stencil directory
      Build with make
      Run the program with ./stencil
      Measure the performance with
         likwid-perfctr -C 0 -g MEM_DP -m ./stencil
      Roofline plot is done with plot_roofline_stencil.py

# MultiMatTest (Book: section 4.3)
      Build with cmake
      Run the program with ./MultiMatTest
      Performance numbers and expected values from performance model are output
